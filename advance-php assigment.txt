1) What Is Object Oriented Programming?

oops stands for object oriented programming structured language 
oops used in advanced php this is start to support php5 | php7 | php 8
oops used to make secured applications 
MVC architectures is used oops concepts to make secured application 
Model | view and controller this is an architectures where we used oops 

2) What Are Properties Of Object Oriented Systems?

a) class
  b) object 
  c) inheritance 
        1) single inheritance 
        2) multilevel inheritance 
        3) multiple inheritance 

  d) abstractions 
  e) polymorphism 
        1) method_overloading 
        2) method_overriding 
        
  f) encapsulation 

3) What Is Difference Between Class And Interface?
A class is a blueprint for objects, while an interface declares a set of methods that a class must implement

4) What Is Overloading?
when we completed any applications using same function pass with different arguments there we used method overloading.

5) What Is T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIM (Scope Resolution Operator (::) with Example
 in PHP T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIM is the token name for :: , the static separator.

        $name="I am rahul bagada";
        echo $name;

A::display();
?>
6) What are the differences between abstract classes and interfaces?

7) Define Constructor and Destructor?
       constructor is same name of class when we called the object of any class constructor automatically called
        function __construct()
       {
       // initialize the object and its properties by assigning 
       //values
       }

Destructors are for destroying objects and automatically called at the end of execution.
      function __destruct()
       {
       // initialize the object and its properties by assigning 
       //values
       }

8) How to Load Classes in PHP?
PHP load classes are used for declaring its object etc. in object oriented applications. PHP parser loads it automatically, if it is registered with spl_autoload_register() function. 


9) How to Call Parent Constructor?
a call to parent::__construct() within the child constructor is required

10) Are Parent Constructor Called Implicitly When Create An ObjectOf Class?
We can't run directly the parent class constructor in child class if the child class defines a constructor. In order to run a parent constructor, a call to parent::__construct() within the child constructor is required.

11) What Happen, If Constructor Is Defined As Private Or Protected?
if Constructor is defined as private or protected as declare so runtime fatal error show

12) What are PHP Magic Methods/Functions? List them Write program for Static Keyword in PHP?
 provide a way to implement certain functionalities in PHP classes that are automatically triggered in response to specific events or operations and magic method double underscore to define.
 __constructor, __decstructor, set, get 
The static keyword is used to declare properties and methods of a class as static. Static properties and methods can be used without creating an instance of the class.
The static keyword is also used to declare variables in a function which keep their value after the function has ended.
